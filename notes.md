## Detailed Notes


### Are Good-Looking People More Employable?

* Israel  
  * Decision to include photo left on the candidate without prejudice  
  * This limits the scope of the study  
    * While there might be similar processes in place in different places, the custom such as not-including a photo in the US might overrule them  
* Men  
  * No photo < plain-looking < attractive  
* Women  
  * Attractive < plain-looking < no photo  
  * In contradiction with studies stating that face-to-face attractiveness improves their chances  
* When a hiring agency was involved, this negative bias for women fell in significance  
* They do not say they hire more of the men but that they are 22% more likely to be invited for an interview when attractive  
* I personally see that when someone cares about his health and body they he might be more liked and create a more collaborative and safe community for the company which is a good reason for not considering only technical skills
