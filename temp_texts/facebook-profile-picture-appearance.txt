Abstract
We investigate whether the publicly available information on Facebook about job
applicants affects employers’ hiring decisions. To this end, we conduct a field experiment
in which fictitious job applications are sent to real job openings in Belgium. The only
characteristic in which these candidates differ is the unique Facebook profile that can
be found online with their name. Candidates with the most beneficial Facebook picture
obtain approximately 38% more job interview invitations compared to candidates with
the least beneficial picture. In addition, we find suggestive evidence for a higher effect
of Facebook profile picture appearance on hiring chances when candidates are highly
educated and when recruiters are female.

Introduction
A recent theme in popular media has been that employers increasingly use the personal
information available on social networking websites (SNS) to make hiring decisions
(see, for example, CareerBuilder, 2012). Furthermore, contributions to the academic literature have provided arguments why this supposed use of SNS by employers may be
rational. First, Kluemper and Rosen (2009) have found that recruiters can accurately
determine productivity-related traits solely on the basis of the personal information about
a candidate available on SNS. Moreover, this information can be gained with little time

and effort and covertly (Berkelaar, 2014; Brown and Vaughn, 2011; Ramirez et al., 2002;
Westerman et al., 2008). Second, according to Back et al. (2010) and Gosling et al.
(2008), people’s appearance on SNS reflects their actual personality traits and not their
self-idealisations. However, this rationality of online screening is not absolute (e.g. when
recruiters use SNS to confirm a hiring decision that they have in fact already made;
Elzweig and Peeples, 2009), and ethical concerns can be raised (e.g. the fact that information on employees is publicly available does not mean that these employees want to
share this information with employers; Brown and Vaughn, 2011).
Given popular and scholarly evidence that suggests that employers consult SNS for
hiring decisions, in this article, we measure by means of scientific tools to what extent
the information publicly available on SNS affects hiring decisions. In this study, we
focus on the impact of the only social media item employers are able to use, in practice,
to screen many job candidates: their Facebook profile picture. Our main research question is the following:
R1. Does job candidates’ Facebook profile picture appearance affect recruiters’ first
hiring decisions?
To answer this question, we conducted a randomised field experiment in Belgium.
We constructed two template résumés and cover letters, equal in all job-relevant characteristics, for male graduates holding either the same secondary or tertiary education
degree. These pairs of applications were sent to 1056 genuine job openings in various
sectors. To each of the applications, we randomly assigned one of the four facial pictures with diverging scores on perceived attractiveness and the Big Five Personality
Dimensions (agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion and
openness). In half of the application pairs we sent out, these pictures were attached to
the résumés, while for the other half of the pairs, they were used as Facebook profile
pictures. By monitoring the subsequent reactions from the employer side, the (absolute and relative) unequal treatment based on the pictures revealed by the Facebook
profile (and résumé) pictures was directly identified and could be given a causal
interpretation.
This experimental setting allowed us to answer two secondary research questions:
R2. How does the effect of particular Facebook profile pictures on recruiters’ decisions compare with their effect when attached to the candidates’ résumés?
R3. To which extent does the effect of Facebook profile picture appearance on hiring
outcomes vary by candidate characteristics (such as education level) and job characteristics (such as level of customer contact and gender of the recruiter)?

Literature review and hypotheses
From a broad perspective, this study contributes to the broad literature on SNS in the
social and behavioural sciences. This literature was reviewed by, for instance, Caers
et al. (2013), Rains and Brunner (2015), Roth et al. (2013), Wilson et al. (2012) and
Zhang and Leung (2015). Many of these reviews highlight that SNS have disrupted

Baert

3

hiring practices. In this study, we measure the extent to which the availability of a particular SNS affects first selection outcomes.
In addition, our study contributes to the broad literature on (profile) picture selection
and evaluation via social media. This literature shows that due to their use on social
media, personal photographs have become more effective as objects of communication
than of memory. For individuals who share them, they have become a tool for self-representation and self-expression (Van Dijck, 2008; Van House, 2011). For those who see
them, these pictures lead to social comparison and impression formation (Haferkamp
and Krämer, 2011; Lebel and Danylchuk, 2014; Wang et al., 2010). Whether this impression formation not only affects one’s digital brand and popularity but also one’s employment chances is central to this study.
From a narrower perspective, our study is most closely related to six studies on the
self-reported use of SNS by recruiters.1 These six studies are summarised in Table A.1
(available online). Depending on the time, country and sector where the survey is
conducted, the proportion of examined recruiters indicating that they employ SNS
when screening job candidates varies between 8.1% (use of Facebook in Greece in
2009–2010) and 50.0% (use of any SNS in the United States in 2010; Caers and
Castelyns, 2011; Chang and Madera, 2012; Gibbs et al., 2015; Nikolaou, 2014; Roulin
and Bangerter, 2013; Tufts et al., 2015). In addition, while Gibbs et al. (2015) found
that employers perceive SNS as being more useful in recruiting lower level employees than higher level employees, Chang and Madera (2012) found the opposite to be
true.
The aforementioned six studies based on self-reported information from employers
suffer, in our opinion, from two methodological problems. First, employers’ reported
attitudes and behaviour might not represent their actual hiring behaviour (Pager and
Quillian, 2005). They might adapt their answers to their perception of whether the use
of SNS in the recruitment process is socially desirable.2 Second, even if the measures of
SNS use by employers based on self-reported information square with their actual
behaviour, these measures would still not reveal the extent to which the information on
SNS affects hiring decisions. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, recruiters may just use
SNS to confirm a hiring decision that they have, in fact, already made (Elzweig and
Peeples, 2009).3
Finally, the present research builds on the multidisciplinary literature dealing with the
beauty premium (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994; Mobius and Rosenblat, 2006) and personality premium (Barrick and Mount, 1991; Uysal and Pohlmeier, 2011) in the labour
market. The theoretical mechanisms underlying better labour market outcomes for more
attractive people are, for instance, productivity drivers related to beauty, such as selfconfidence (Mobius and Rosenblat, 2006) and employer discrimination (Mauzer-Fazio
and Lei, 2015). Concerning the personality premium, the psychological literature provides evidence for personality traits having an effect on job proficiency (Barrick and
Mount, 1991). In particular, conscientiousness has been found to be a driver of productivity and, consequently, of labour market success (Baert and Decuypere, 2014; Mueller
and Plug, 2006). In addition, emotional stability and openness to experience are positively related to beneficial labour market outcomes (Baert and Decuypere, 2014; Uysal
and Pohlmeier, 2011).

Drawing on the suggestive evidence on the use of SNS by recruiters and the academic
literatures on impression formation via social media pictures and the premium for beauty
and personality in the labour market, we propose the following hypothesis:
H1. Job candidates with more physically and psychologically attractive Facebook
profile pictures will receive more positive callbacks in response to their job
applications.
Concerning the relative effect of variation in Facebook profile pictures compared to
the effect of these pictures when employed as résumé pictures, we are in two minds. On
one hand, the probability that a candidate’s facial picture is seen is higher when it is
attached to her or his résumé than when it is made available as a Facebook profile picture. Consequently, the chance of affecting hiring outcomes is higher for résumé pictures
than for Facebook profile pictures, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, the magnitude of
the impact of a facial picture might be higher when it is seen as a Facebook profile picture than when it is seen as a résumé picture. This assumption is supported by the evidence mentioned in the introduction regarding people’s appearances on SNS reflecting
their actual personality traits and not their self-idealisations. In addition, Roulin and
Bangerter (2013) and Berkelaar and Buzzanell (2015) describe the information on the
SNS profiles of job candidates as ‘more honest signals of their ability and commitment’
(because job candidates might not be aware that employers screen their personal
Facebook profiles) and as ‘less subject to extreme impression management’, at least in
the perception of recruiters, compared to information in their résumés. As a consequence,
the fact that only some recruiters screen Facebook may be compensated for by their perception of Facebook profile pictures as more honest signals of applicants’ ability and
commitment. A caveat in this respect is that the aforementioned studies focused on perceptions based on extensive Facebook profiles (not only showing a profile picture).
Consequently, their findings cannot just be generalised to our setting. Nevertheless, supported by this literature, we propose the following hypothesis:
H2. Facial pictures equally affect positive callback when these pictures are used as
Facebook profile pictures and when they are used as résumé pictures.
Finally, we propose hypotheses with respect to the heterogeneity of the effect of a
person’s Facebook profile picture appearance on hiring outcomes by candidate characteristics and job characteristics. First, one could expect that highly educated candidates
would be screened more on Facebook, as they seem to be more engaged in social media
(Correa et al., 2010).4 Second, based on the fact that women employ social media in
general, and Facebook in particular, more than men (Vasalou et al., 2010), a beneficial
Facebook profile picture might be expected to yield a higher surplus when recruiters are
female, ceteris paribus.5 Third, in line with Mauzer-Fazio and Lei (2015), we expect the
returns on perceived attractiveness and beneficial personality traits to be higher in jobs
where customer contact is more important. Fourth, when an employer must fill a vacancy
in an occupation where labour market tightness6 is high, recruiters are expected to have
a lower number of job candidates, so discriminating on (Facebook profile or résumé)

Baert

picture appearance is going to be costlier (Baert et al., 2015). For this reason, we expect
that the surplus of a highly rated Facebook profile picture is going to be higher in occupations where labour market tightness is low. These lines of reasoning yield the following
hypotheses:
H3a. Facebook profile picture appearance affects hiring chances more for highly educated candidates.
H3b. Facebook profile picture appearance affects hiring chances more when recruiters are female.
H3c. Facebook profile picture appearance affects hiring chances more for jobs where
customer contact is more important.
H3d. Facebook profile picture appearance affects hiring chances more for vacancies
that are easy to fill.

Methods
Correspondence experiment
Over the past few decades, social and behavioural scientists have conducted various correspondence experiments to measure unequal treatment in the labour market (Bertrand
and Mullainathan, 2004; Correll et al., 2007). Within this type of experiment, pairs of
fictitious job applications are sent to real job openings. These applications differ only in
the characteristic that is to be tested. This characteristic is randomly assigned within each
pair of applicants. By monitoring the subsequent callbacks, unequal treatment in first
hiring decisions based on this characteristic can be identified. This measure of unequal
treatment can be given a causal interpretation. Selection based on individual unobservable characteristics is eliminated as the researcher fully controls the information available to the employer. This allows her or him to disentangle unequal treatment from
alternative explanations of heterogeneous hiring outcomes, such as differences in preferences and behaviour at the employee side or differences in human capital.7
We conducted our field experiment between November 2013 and May 2014 in the
labour market of Flanders, the northern part of Belgium.8 During the period of the experiment, we tested 1056 vacancies in the database of the Public Employment Agency of
Flanders, that is, the region’s most important job search channel. More concretely, we
randomly selected 528 vacancies for jobs targeting labour market entrants with a secondary education degree in commerce and 528 vacancies for jobs targeting labour market
entrants with a master’s degree in commercial sciences. A total of two job applications of
graduates, identical in terms of productivity-relevant characteristics, were sent to the
selected vacancies. To each candidate within our pairs of applicants, we randomly
assigned one of the four facial pictures differing in attractiveness and personality traits.
For half of the pairs, these pictures were employed as the pair members’ Facebook profile picture.9 By monitoring the subsequent callbacks for these pairs by profile picture,
unequal treatment based on the candidates’ Facebook profile picture could be identified
(and H1 could be tested). For the other half of the pairs, the same pictures were used as

6

the pair members’ résumé picture. As a result, we were able to test H2.10,11 Figure A.1
(Figure A.2, available online) summarises the data gathering process for the sub-experiment in which the pictures were used as a Facebook profile picture (résumé picture). This
data gathering is described in more detail below.

Construction of job application template pairs
For each of the aforementioned two academic degrees held by our fictitious applicants, we
created two template applications comprising a résumé and a cover letter. We will refer to
them as Type A and Type B application types. These types were equal in all productivityrelevant characteristics but differed in layout and details, such as the particular cultural
activity mentioned. To ensure that our application templates were realistic and representative, example applications from the Public Employment Agency of Flanders were used
and calibrated for our purposes.
Type A and Type B applicants shared the following characteristics. They were single
male graduates born, studying and living in comparable suburbs of the cities of Antwerp
and Leuven. We appended a fictitious postal address (a real street but a non-existing
street number) and a date of birth to all application templates. In addition, all applicants
had the Belgian nationality, work experience from two student jobs, adequate (and comparable) information and communications technology (ICT) and language skills, a driver’s licence and sports and cultural activities. Our candidates graduated in June 2013,
from a school with a comparable reputation, without any grade retention experience. In
line with the particular vacancy to which the pair of applications was sent, a specialisation was chosen. For the secondary education degree in commerce, the specialisations
used were (a) commerce (no specific specialisation), (b) accountancy, (c) ICT, (d) secretariat and languages and (e) tourism. For the master’s in commercial sciences, the specialisations used were (a) accountancy and taxes, (b) financial management, (c) human
resource management, (d) international affairs and (e) marketing management. These
different specialisations allowed us to apply for various occupations.12
The minimal differences between Type A and Type B application templates could not
bias our results. This is the case as the treatment of interest – that is, the candidate’s facial
picture – was, for each vacancy, randomly assigned to these types (as a résumé or
Facebook profile picture). This random assignment is the subject of the next subsection.
Moreover, the regression analysis presented below shows that these minimal differences
did not yield different callback outcomes for our two application types.

Randomised assignment of Facebook profile and résumé pictures
The pictures used for our experiment were selected from those employed in the laboratory experiment of Baert and Decuypere (2014). In that study, which was to some extent
a preparatory study for the present one, 195 raters scored 22 pictures of young graduates,
selected from picture databases, on the Big Five Personality Dimensions and on attractiveness. Personality traits were rated using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (Gosling
et al., 2003) for each photograph. This yielded a single index for each personality trait
between 1 and 7 for each picture. Attractiveness was measured by the participants’

Baert

7

assessment of the statement ‘I see this person as attractive’ on a 7-point Likert scale,
yielding a final index between 1 and 7.
Based on the testers’ rating, we identified four facial pictures with diverging scores on
attractiveness and personality. These pictures are included in Figures A.3 to A.6 (available online). Pictures 1 and 2 are facial pictures that received beneficial scores. Picture 1
was chosen for its high score both on attractiveness, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability and openness. This picture, however, had only a moderate score with
respect to the personality trait that is generally found to drive productivity the most:
conscientiousness (see earlier). Picture 2 was chosen for its high score on conscientiousness (and moderate scores with respect to attractiveness and the other personality dimensions). Picture 3 got relatively moderate scores for all characteristics. Picture 4 was a
picture yielding poor scores, both on attractiveness and personality traits.13
The random assignment of one of the four pictures to each of the two job application
template types was realised by a procedure in which we alternated between the 12 possible pairs of applications sent to employers. For each vacancy, one of the four pictures
was assigned to Type A template, and one of the (remaining) three pictures was assigned
to Type B template.
In addition, we alternated pairs who revealed their facial pictures by pasting them
directly into their résumé and pairs who made their pictures publicly available as their
Facebook profile picture. For the latter pairs, no picture was added to their résumés. For
these pairs, the first name and surname of the candidates led, by searching for it on
Google or by typing it into the Facebook search bar, to a single Facebook profile (and no
other Google hits). These fictitious profiles were under our control and only publicly
displayed the (current) profile picture of the candidate (resulting in similar profile settings for the pair members). For the former pairs (pasting their facial pictures directly
into their résumé), the common first name and surname combinations of the candidates’
led to tens of Facebook profile pictures, preventing the employer from screening the
candidate through Facebook. It is important to mention that we made sure that the names
we chose did not represent a different social background, following Bloothooft and
Onland (2011) who linked the suffix of the first name Dutch-speaking parents choose for
their children to these children’s later wages.
The combinations of application template types and experimental identities by facial
picture were sent to the employers between 24 November 2013 and 20 April 2014, in an
alternating order, each time with approximately 24 hours between the pair members.

Classifications of callbacks
In the next section, we will analyse the employers’ response to our fictitious applications. Callbacks were received by telephone voicemail or email. We follow the literature in distinguishing between two definitions of positive callback. Positive callback in
strict sense means the applicant was invited for an interview concerning the posted job.
Positive callback in broad sense also includes a request to contact the recruiter by telephone or to provide more information by email or the proposal of an alternative job.
All callbacks received later than 30 days after sending out the application were
neglected.

8

Before presenting our results, we restate our first two hypotheses in terms of the
experimental design. In line with H1, we expect that candidates who have Picture 1 or
Picture 2 as their Facebook profile picture have, given the beneficial scores of these pictures on perceived attractiveness and personality, better chances of being hired than candidates who have Picture 3, and they, in turn, have better chances of being hired than
those who have Picture 4 as their Facebook profile picture. We have no a priori expectations concerning the relative treatment of candidates who have Picture 1 versus candidates who have Picture 2 as their Facebook profile picture.

Results
Positive callback ratios
In total, the candidates who had Picture 1, Picture 2, Picture 3 or Picture 4 as a Facebook
profile picture obtained a positive callback in strict sense (broad sense) in 9.8% (22.7%),
7.6% (19.3%), 7.6% (22.7%) and 5.3% (17.0%) of their applications, respectively. The
mentioned callback rates perfectly follow the ordering as expected based on H1, as
restated at the end of the previous section. There is one exception: the positive callback
rate in broad sense is higher for those who had Picture 3 as a Facebook profile picture
(22.7%) than for those who had Picture 2 (19.3%).
The corresponding positive callback rates are 6.8% (18.9%), 9.5% (20.4%), 5.7%
(18.6%) and 5.3% (14.8%) for the candidates who attached Picture 1, Picture 2, Picture
3 and Picture 4 directly to their résumé. These numbers follow the aforementioned ordering without any exception.
To compare the mentioned positive callback rates in a structured manner, we calculate a statistic frequently employed in correspondence studies: the positive callback ratio (PCR). This statistic is calculated by dividing the positive callback rate
when using a particular picture (as a Facebook profile or résumé picture) by the
corresponding positive callback rate when employing another particular picture.
Table 1 presents the PCRs, following the strict sense definition of positive callback,
at the level of the total data set and for various subsamples.14 As we use the positive
callback rates of the pictures with a lower index (picture number) as the numerator
of these ratios and the corresponding callback rates of the pictures with a higher
index as the denominator, PCRs above 1 are expected given H1. A single exception
in this respect is the PCR comparing candidates with Picture 1 to candidates with
Picture 2: as indicated earlier, we have no a priori expectations concerning their relative hiring chances.
At the level of the total data set, Panel A.1 of Table 1 shows a PCR in strict sense that
is significantly higher than 1 when comparing candidates using Picture 1 as a Facebook
profile picture to candidates using Picture 4 for the same purpose (p = .020). More concretely, the PCR is 1.857, indicating that the former candidates obtained 85.7% more job
interview invitations. This finding supports H1.
The significant PCRs for the pairs of candidates pasting the facial pictures directly
into their résumés (presented in Panel B.1) are also consistent with our expectations.
More concretely, when the pictures are employed as résumé pictures, we find a

statistically significant preference in respect of employers for Picture 2 above Picture 3
(p = .029) and Picture 4 (p = .048).
Next, to explore the support for H3a, H3b, H3c and H3d, we present PCRs for subsamples of our data by candidate and job characteristics. More concretely, we breakdown
our data by proxies of (a) the education level of the candidates (Panel A.2 of Table 1), (b)
the gender of the contact person in the vacancy (Panel A.3) as a proxy for the gender of
the person (people) deciding whether or not to invite the candidate to a job interview, (c)
the level of customer contact in the posted job (Panel A.4) and (d) the bottleneck status
of the occupation (Panel A.5). The level of customer contact in the posted job is considered to be intensive in cases where being customer oriented is mentioned explicitly as a
required skill in the job vacancy advertisement. Concerning (d), following Baert et al.
(2015), we first matched each vacancy one to one with an occupation in the classification
list of the Public Employment Agency of Flanders. For each of these occupations, we
were able to look up their ‘bottleneck’ status. Each year, the Public Employment Agency
of Flanders combines three statistical criteria concerning labour market tightness in the
occupation in order to indicate which occupations have this status.15
The statistics presented in Panels A.2, A.3, A.4 and A.5 of Table 1 show that our finding of more favourable hiring chances for candidates using Picture 1 (and Picture 3) as
their Facebook profile picture compared to Picture 4 is driven by the applications (a)
with highly educated candidates, (b) with female recruiters, (c) for posted jobs with low
levels of customer contact and (d) for non-bottleneck occupations. So, the presented
statistics are in line with our hypotheses except for the breakdown of the PCRs by level
of customer contact in the posted job. We come back to the significance of these dimensions of heterogeneity in unequal treatment based on Facebook profile picture appearance in the next subsection.

Regression analysis
As we randomly assigned the four facial pictures to the two applications we sent to the
tested vacancies, regressing positive callback at the individual application level on these
pictures and other candidate and vacancy characteristics should lead to exactly the same
statistical results for a sample size approaching infinity (both for the subsample of candidates who used these pictures as their Facebook profile picture and the subsample of
candidates who used them as their résumé picture). However, our sample size is finite.
Consequently, observable and unobservable determinants of hiring outcomes that vary
across vacancies may happen to correlate with the facial pictures used. To control for this
potential correlation, we perform a regression analysis controlling for random effects at
the vacancy level.16 In addition, this regression analysis allows us to measure the independent effect of the aforementioned variables (a), (b), (c) and (d) interacted with the
Facebook profile (or résumé) picture of the candidate.
Table 2 presents our regression results for the subsample of candidates who have their
facial picture as their Facebook profile picture. We regress the outcome of positive callback in strict sense (Models (1), (2) and (3) in Table 2) and positive callback in broad
sense (Models (4), (5) and (6)) on various sets of variables by means of a linear probability model with random effects at the vacancy level.17

In Model (1) and Model (4), we include only indicators of using Picture 1, Picture 2
and Picture 3 as Facebook profile picture (thus implicitly choosing Picture 4 as the reference picture) as explanatory variables. The regression results in Table 2 show that having
Picture 1 as a Facebook profile picture increases the probability of a job interview invitation with 2.6 percentage points (or 38.2%, that is, 0.026/0.068; p = .055) and the probability of obtaining any positive reaction with 3.8 percentage points (or 20.9%; p = .048) in
comparison with having Picture 4. In addition, having Picture 3 increases the probability
of a positive callback in broad sense with 4.1 percentage points (or 22.5%; p = 0.049).18
These effects controlling for random effects at the vacancy level are somewhat lower
than the ones derived from the corresponding PCRs mentioned above.
Next, in Model (2) and Model (4), we include indicators of the template type employed
and the submission order. As the picture assignment is, by construction, not correlated
with them, the inclusion of these additional variables does not change the Facebook picture effects. Moreover, positive callback outcomes vary neither by template type (as
announced before) nor by place in the sending order.
Finally, in Model (3) and Model (6), we add interactions between the facial pictures
used as Facebook profile picture and indicator variables by which we want to investigate
the heterogeneous effects of these pictures. These variables are (a) an indicator for highly
educated candidates, (b) an indicator for male recruiters, (c) an indicator for jobs with
intensive customer contact and (d) an indicator for bottleneck occupations. The results
for these models confirm our findings based on the descriptive analysis with respect to
the higher surplus of highly scored Facebook profile pictures for highly educated candidates and – to a lesser extent – when recruiters are female. However, we do not find
significant interactions with the indicator for jobs with intensive customer contact or the
indicator for bottleneck occupations after controlling for random effects at the vacancy
level. In conclusion, while the analysis of our data supports H3a and H3b, we do not find
convincing evidence for H3c and H3d.
The corresponding regression results when employing the subsample of candidates
pasting the facial pictures directly into their résumés follow the same pattern.19 In line
with the results presented in Panel B of Table 1, we find the highest positive callback
rates when using Picture 2 as a résumé picture.
H2 predicted that facial pictures equally affect positive callbacks when they are used
as Facebook profile pictures and when they are used as résumé pictures. By comparing
the effects of using Picture 1, Picture 2 and Picture 3 (in comparison with Picture 4) as
Facebook profile picture in Table 2 to the corresponding effects of attaching these pictures to one’s résumé, we observe (a) quite comparable effects with respect to Picture 1
and Picture 3 (thus supporting H2) and (b) a substantially higher effect of Picture 2 when
used as a résumé picture.20

Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether the publicly available information on Facebook
about job applicants affects employers’ hiring decisions. Thereby, we directly contributed to the literature measuring the use of social media in screening job candidates. We
argued that this literature, based on self-reported data, suffers from two methodological

Baert

13

problems: (a) reported attitudes and behaviour may deviate from actual behaviour and
(b) using SNS does not mean letting SNS affect decisions. To overcome these issues, we
conducted a field experiment in the Belgian labour market. Pairs of fictitious job applications were sent to genuine job openings. To each application within a pair, we randomly
assigned one of the four facial pictures varying in attractiveness and personality. For half
of the vacancies, these pictures were directly pasted into the résumés, while for the other
half, we assigned a candidate name to the résumés, which, by searching for it on Google
or by typing it into the Facebook search bar, led to a single Facebook profile. These fictitious profiles were under our control and only publicly displayed the profile picture.21
We found that candidates with the most beneficial Facebook picture got approximately 38% more job interview invitations and 21% more positive reactions in a broad
sense compared to candidates with the least beneficial picture. This surplus of a favourable Facebook picture was higher for the highly educated and when recruiters were
female. Moreover, except for one picture used, we could not reject that variation in
Facebook profile pictures affects positive callbacks with the same magnitude as (the
same) variation in résumé pictures.
From a broader perspective, two important take-away messages from our study are
the following. First, our results support the idea that SNS have disrupted hiring practices, as mentioned in several reviews on SNS in the social and behavioural sciences.
This digital disruption cannot be neglected by scholars in related academic fields such
as labour economics, human resource management, sociology of work and occupational psychology. Theories on matching employees and employers which were built
before the breakthrough of social media should be adapted to the existence of social
media as a search and matching channel (or at least, their robustness against the use of
these new media should be proved).22 Second, our results corroborate the observation
in the literature on (profile) picture selection and evaluation via social media that pictures on these media have a particularly strong effect on impression formation when
other information is limited, as is the case in a résumé (Wang et al., 2010). Whether
this implies that Facebook profile picture appearance affects recruiters’ first hiring
decisions to a lesser extent when résumés and cover letters are more extensive23 could
not be investigated based on our experimental design but is an appealing direction for
further research.
In addition, from a practical point of view, job seekers should see the publicly available
online information about them as an extension of their résumé. For this reason, they should
take proper care with respect to what they share on the Internet. By extension, agencies
guiding these job seekers should consider, in addition to the classical résumé writing tips,
coaching job candidates with respect to their digital impression management.
We end by acknowledging four research limitations inherent to our research focus
and our experimental design. A first important limitation of this study is that we measured only the impact of a very specific social media item, that is, individuals’ Facebook
profile picture, on hiring chances.24 However, for many job candidates, this profile
picture is the only substantial element that they make publicly available on Facebook,
and by extension – given that Facebook is by far the most popular SNS – on social
media. As a consequence, this profile picture is often the only social media item
employers are able to screen in practice. Nevertheless, we are in favour of future

14

new media & society ﻿

studies exploring whether other components of publicly available information (e.g.
number and characteristics of Facebook friends; Tong et al., 2008; Walther et al., 2008)
also affect the employment opportunities of users of social networking sites.25 Second,
our experiment focused on a very particular outcome: callback rates for first interviews. As a result, our findings do not allow us to say anything about unequal treatment based on Facebook profile picture appearance in the later stages of the screening
process. However, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) have argued that lower numbers
of interview invitations are likely to be reflected in a reduced number of job offers.26
Third, our experimental design did not allow us to measure the proportion of employers that screened our fictitious Facebook profile pages, let alone to disentangle the
subsets that found this page via Google versus via the Facebook search bar or to inspect
the extent of the group of employers who searched for online information about our
candidates but did not reach our profile pages.27 Measuring these proportions was not
a goal of our study. As mentioned earlier, in our opinion, it is not the extent of the
screening of SNS (or the online pathway employers follow) that is of societal importance but the effect of this screening (in our case on hiring outcomes). Having this said,
we welcome future studies that are able to decompose the effect of Facebook profile
picture appearance on hiring outcomes into the product of (a) the proportion of employers using SNS as a screening tool and (b) the effect the information on SNS has on
hiring decisions conditional on screening it. Finally, our experimental design only
allowed us to measure the relative effect of the variation in (personality traits and
attractiveness of) four particular pictures on first hiring decisions. As a consequence,
we were not able to measure the effect of having a Facebook profile compared to the
control situation of not having such a profile. This is a limitation, as recent research
suggests that absence of online information might be punished by employers (Berkelaar,
2014). In addition, based on our data, it is not possible to tell whether personality or
attractiveness (or a combination of both) drove the relative callbacks our fictitious
candidates received. Moreover, it is a limitation that we did not let our pictures be
scored on (relative) appropriateness for use as a Facebook profile picture and as a
résumé picture.28 These scores might have helped to explain the (limited) differences
in how our pictures affected callbacks when used for both purposes.

Notes
1. Besides this literature, the effect of social networking appearance on hiring chances has also
been tested by means of laboratory experiments (Roulin and Bangerter, 2013). However,
these experiments do not allow one to measure the extent to which social networking websites (SNS) are used in practice when evaluating job candidates. In addition, Berkelaar and
Buzzanell (2014, 2015) and Berkelaar et al. (2015) have conducted (qualitative) research
on the general use of online information in personnel selection. Finally, Acquisti and Fong
(2015) have studied how employers use online information in a broad sense to discriminate
based on race and sexual orientation.
2. Madera (2012) has shown that perceived fairness and job pursuit intentions by job applicants
are lower for organisations using SNS as a selection tool.
3. In addition to these two problems, the analysis of self-reported information on the use of
SNS in screening job candidates is hampered by the variability in available information on
candidates’ profile pages due to variation in the extent to which these candidates are active on
SNS and in their (customisable) privacy settings (Brown and Vaughn, 2011). This variability,
which cannot be controlled based on employers’ self-reports, might be correlated with other
determinants of employment opportunities (e.g. the gender, education level, region, sector
and personality of the candidate). Not taking into account this variability in available information might, as a consequence, bias measures of how appearance on SNS does affect hiring
chances for different subpopulations.
4. However, theoretical and empirical studies show that, in general, unequal treatment based on
subjective factors is lower for the highly educated as higher education degrees reduce uncertainty about job candidates (Baert et al., 2015). As a consequence, the need to make inferences about these candidates’ ability based on informally gathered information about them is
also lower.
5. Two implicit assumptions are made here: (a) the higher share of Facebook users among
women translates into a higher share of recruiters using Facebook within the professional
context and (b) Facebook profile pictures, when seen by recruiters, affect the hiring decisions
of females at least as much as those of males.
6. The labour market tightness in an occupation is defined as the ratio of the number of vacancies in the occupation to the number of unemployed with the required qualifications (Baert
et al., 2015).
7. For an in-depth discussion of the ethical aspects of the correspondence experimentation
framework, we refer to Riach and Rich (2004).
8. The hiring landscape in Belgium is constrained by two characteristics of its labour market.
First, overall, the competition for human capital is, compared to other European countries,
relatively high (Gerard and Valsamis, 2015). An indicator for a country’s labour market tightness is its job vacancy rate. This is the number of vacancies as a percentage of the sum of
this number of vacancies and the number of occupied jobs. In the first quarter of 2014, the
job vacancy rate was 2.2% in Belgium, while it was 1.5% in the EU-27. Only in Germany
and Norway was this statistic higher (source: Eurostat, job vacancy rate). Second, related to
the country’s historically high employment protection and union coverage, labour market
contracts are heavily regulated (Baert and Omey, 2015). With respect to social media use,
following Global Webindex (http://www.globalwebindex.net/), in the first quarter of 2016,

about 59% of Belgian citizens aged 12 years or older used Facebook at least once each day.
According to this statistic, it is the most popular social media tool in Belgium, followed at a
distance by YouTube and Instagram. In contrast to most other social media tools, Facebook is
used in Belgium by a substantial proportion of all age groups (source: Global Webindex, Q1
2016).
Our choice of a person’s Facebook profile picture appearance as a social media item that is
potentially screened by employers was motivated by the following considerations. First, with
>1.49 billion monthly active users (as of 30 June 2015), Facebook is the world’s most popular
SNS (Facebook, 2015). Second, a substantial fraction of Facebook users allow other users
to whom they are not connected as friends to see essentially only their name and Facebook
profile picture. For this reason, being only able to judge job candidates’ Facebook profile
picture is a situation in which many employers find themselves in reality. Third, allowing
only (randomised) variation in our fictitious candidates’ facial pictures keeps the controlled
experimental setting feasible. Fourth, facial pictures, nevertheless, allow employers to screen
candidates’ attractiveness and personality traits. This is potentially relevant information, as,
following a survey of the popular job search website CareerBuilder (2012), the most important aspect that recruiters mention with respect to screening job candidates’ Facebook profiles
is making inferences about these candidates’ personality that might not be as easily obtained
through traditional screening.
By also sending out pairs disclosing their facial picture as a résumé picture, we anticipated
a zero effect of the Facebook profile pictures on hiring outcomes. This zero effect could
have been explained by two important reasons: (a) recruiters did not screen job candidates’
Facebook profile pictures and/or (b) the pictures we used did not yield diverging hiring
chances if they were screened. A non-zero effect of these pictures, when pasted directly
to one’s résumé, could have ruled out explanation (b), if we were willing to assume that
Facebook profile pictures and résumé pictures, if they are screened, affect employers’ hiring
decisions roughly to an equal extent.
In Belgium, adding a picture to one’s résumé is not uncommon. At the website of the Public
Employment Agency of Flanders, it is written (in Dutch) that ‘if you add a picture [to your
résumé], your résumé gets a face’ (https://www.vdab.be/werkinzicht/vragencv#foto), and
résumés with pictures are used as example résumés (https://www.vdab.be/werkinzicht/
cvvoorbeelden.shtml).
Testing multiple occupations (rather than just one) was important because it enabled us to
avoid the danger inherent in many former correspondence experiments in which researchers
simply selected an occupation with, potentially, a particularly high (or low) surplus of the
tested characteristics. In addition, the variety in occupations enabled us to measure heterogeneous treatment effects by the customer contact level at the posted job level and labour market
tightness at the occupational level (and thus allowed us to test H3c and H3d).
More concretely, Picture 1, Picture 2, Picture 3 and Picture 4 scored, on average, 4.34 (third highest out of 22 pictures), 3.53 (11/22), 4.22 (5/22) and 2.75 (22/22) on attractiveness; 4.66 (2/22),
4.32 (6/22), 4.11 (16/22) and 3.98 (18/22) on agreeableness; 4.43 (7/22), 4.86 (1/22), 4.23 (12/22)
and 3.90 (15/22) on conscientiousness; 5.13 (1/22), 4.30 (11/22), 4.49 (7/22) and 3.66 (22/22)
on emotional stability; 5.07 (3/22), 5.04 (4/22), 4.10 (13/22) and 2.88 (22/22) on extraversion;
and 5.09 (2/22), 4.60 (10/22), 4.29 (13/22) and 3.55 (22/22) on openness. The consensus in the
peer-reviewed literature is that all these factors have a non-negative effect on productivity, except
for agreeableness, for which, besides zero effects, both (slightly) positive and (slightly) negative
effects have been found (Baert and Decuypere, 2014; Barrick and Mount, 1991).
Analyses following the broad sense definition of positive callback, which are available on
request, yield the same conclusions.

15. These criteria are the following: (a) there must be at least 10 vacancies registered in the
database of the Public Employment Agency of Flanders for this occupation, (b) the vacancy
filling rate in this occupation must be lower than the median filling rate for all occupations
together and (c) the median duration until a vacancy in this occupation is filled must be
greater than the median for all occupations together.
16. See, for example, Verbeek (2004) for an introduction to random effects models. Basically, this
approach allows one to control for random factors, independently and identically distributed
over, in our case, vacancies. As a result, the error term of the regression model consists of
two components: a vacancy-specific component and a remainder component. Random effect
models can be estimated by means of the command ‘xtreg’ in Stata. As an alternative, we
estimated fixed effects models, that is, linear regressions in which the intercept terms vary
over the vacancies (Verbeek, 2004). This, however, yielded the same conclusions.
17. For reasons of comparability of the results for our different regression models, except for the
picture indicators, all the variables are normalised by subtracting their mean value among the
candidates with Picture 1, Picture 2 or Picture 3 as their Facebook profile or résumé picture.
18. The standard errors of the effects of Picture 1, Picture 2 and Picture 3 vary from 0.010 to
0.014 (0.017–0.021) in Model 1 (Model (4)). This means that in Model (1), effects of 2–3 percentage points (i.e. between 0.010 × 1.96 × 100 and 0.014 × 1.96 × 100) and higher could be
rejected at the 5% significance level, and in Model (4), effects of 3.5 percentage points and
higher could be rejected. Broadly speaking, the power of the study, with 1056 fictitious applications for each sub-experiment is comparable to other, well-published studies conducting the
same kind of experiments (e.g. Correll et al., 2007).
19. These regression results are available on request.
20. This was tested formally in an analysis of a data set pooling the information for both subexperiments. This exercise, which is available on request, yielded the same conclusions.
21. At the time of the experiment, making (besides their name) only their current profile picture
publicly available (and not, for example, their cover picture), was a ‘privacy setting’ chosen
by a substantial number of people.
22. For instance, recently Lutgen and Van der Linden (2015) adapted the matching theory for
which Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen and Christopher Pissarides won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 2010 to include the fact that social media helps both employers and employees
to more easily find potential partners, even faraway.
23. This finding would be consistent with Arrow’s (1973) theory of statistical discrimination.
24. In addition, this effect is measured for young, male candidates within the tested occupations only.
As a consequence, our results cannot be generalised to the surplus of beneficial Facebook profile
pictures in other occupations than those covered in this study and for other types of candidates.
25. The relative importance of these components could, for instance, be studied by means of eye
tracking experiments in which recruiters are asked to make fictitious hiring decisions based
on job candidates’ (fully public) social networking profiles, with their eye movements being
observed (and analysed) when screening these profiles.
26. Furthermore, because job interviews are costly, employers invite job candidates to an interview only if these applicants have a reasonable chance of getting the job (Baert et al., 2016).
27. We believe that the latter group should have been very small given the popularity of Google
as a starting point to explore the Internet and the aforementioned popularity of Facebook in
the SNS market.
28. We informally asked human resource managers to screen our pictures on appropriateness for
both purposes. As a consequence, a candidate picture with a person wearing a headphone was
excluded as these human resource managers judged this picture to be inappropriate for use as
a résumé picture.
