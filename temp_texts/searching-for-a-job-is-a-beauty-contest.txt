Searching for a job is a beauty contest
Giovanni Busetta∗, Fabio Fiorillo∗ and Emanuela Visalli∗

ABSTRACT
The paper deals with the impact of beauty on employability of people, stressing the first stage of the
hiring process. In particular, we studied if there exists a preference for attractive candidates and if it
does whether it depends on sex, physical features and racial characteristics.
We monitored all relevant agencies offering jobs in Italy from August 2011 to September 2012
sending 11008 CVs to 1542 advertised job openings. To do so, we construct fake CVs and we sent
the same CV 8 times, changing only name and surname, address, and the photo included. In
particular, we sent 4 CVs with photo of an attractive and unattractive man and women, and 4 CVs
without photo of an Italian and a foreign men and women to each job opening.
Callbacks rates are statistically significant higher for attractive women and men than unattractive
ones. Racial discrimination appears to be statistically relevant, but less than discrimination based on
the physical features, especially for women.

Keywords: beauty premium, racial discrimination, experimental economics.

1. Introduction
Aristotele said: “Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference” After
thousands of years this concept continues to hold.
In nowadays’ society people are often discriminated for their physical attractiveness. Discrimination
based on the various components of physical appearance results in “premia” for those individuals
characterized by certain attributes, and in penalties for persons failing to match the given standard.

In France, the country of the Enlightenment and human rights, people refer to the aesthetic
discrimination in terms of “beautism”. This kind of discrimination is so widespread that several
candidates to work positions use to include into their CVs, not only their skills and titles (such as
education, languages spoken, experiences, etc), but also a “video resume” in which they present and
enhances themselves.
“Pole D’Eploi” is a French firm at which it is possible to attend a course called “action looking” to
learn tricks and how to dress-up in order to encourage recruitment in job interviews. In this way, the
selection of candidates for a job becomes similar to a casting.
In Italy this kind of discrimination appears to be particularly relevant. In “casting’s society”, an
article published in 2011 on “la Repubblica”, one of the main Italian newspapers, Anais Ginori
describes a survey published by Sofres Institute. The results of the survey show that clothing and
manner of presentation improve the probability of being employed by 82% for candidates with
same degree and experience. The economic crisis has made recruitment techniques even more
ruthless. First impressions are crucial and, as the author wrote in the same article, this rule also
applies to the work of back office.
Is such discrimination a novelty in Italian labor market? Actually, Italy is a dualistic country.
Dualism is a common issue in Italy and it is based on several explanations 1. It is the result of past
determinants: sociological (differences in social capital, Putnam 1993), economical (differences in
workforce coming out from agriculture, Bagnasco 1977) and institutional (formal norms vs
informal rules, Tabellini 2008). Because of dualism, also the access to the job differs regarding
regions: job opportunities, which reflect firms’ labor demand, were concentrated in the North and
the Center of the Country and they are definitely much more for man than women (Table 1).

Therefore, data reported in Table 1 depend on the number of firms and the industrial structure of the
area which behaved differently in different regions. Different firms behaviors not necessarily persist
in the present as it was in the past. In particular, we wonder if, also in Italy, the considerations
underlined by the theory of beautism on the relevance of attractiveness premia in the hiring process
could be more important than explanation based on dualism in influencing the probability of
receiving a job offer.
Furthermore, Italy is a growing immigration country. For this reason it is relevant to investigate
whether Italian labor market is affected by racial discrimination. As showed, among others, by a
recent analysis performed by Italy's National Office against Racial Discrimination (UNAR), an
institution which collaborate with United Nations, discrimination based on race has increased by
61% between 2011 and 2012.
The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether the dualisms, traditionally characterizing
Italian labor market (e.g. discriminations based on region), are still the ones mainly influencing
1 Fratianni (2012).

firms hiring decisions or whether, instead, there are new determinants to investigate on. If this is the
case, what is, among education, nationality, job characteristics, gender and attractiveness, the most
relevant variable affecting candidates’ probability to get a jog?
Since we want to analyse the influence of race and attractiveness in the hiring process, we have to
face two problems common in literature. Firstly, authors (Biddle and Hamermesh 1998, Mobius and
Rosenblat 2006, Parrett 2007, Eckel and Ragan 2011, Etcoff, Stock, Haley, Vickery and House
2011) commonly consider small samples of students answering hypothetical questions on hiring
decisions, and, secondly, it is often impossible for researchers to control for employees'
qualifications and abilities.
On the contrary, in the analysis that we are going to present, we used an empirical strategy that, to
our knowledge, has never been applied to Italian labor market. This methodology consists in
building up an ad hoc created database sending fake CVs to real job openings solving, in this way,
both the two problems previously mentioned. Indeed, we analyzed a huge sample based on 11008
CVs sent to real job offers posted by actual employers, obtaining 3278 callbacks (approximately
30% of the CVs sent).
Moreover, the design of our experiment (as already done for Argentina by Bóo, Rossi, and Urzua
2013) gives us the complete control and observability over candidates' backgrounds, solving in this
way the second problem previously mentioned. In effect, our applicants are identical in every
respect (including their education, work experience, language and computer skills) for each kind of
job offer: name, nationality, sex, race and pictures (or lack thereof) are the only informations which
change in between different CVs sent to the same job offer. Moreover, the applications completely
fulfill employer requirements regarding education, experience and so on.
This methodology is similar to the one applied by Ruffle and Sthudiner (2010) to explore the effect
of attractiveness (or lack thereof) on the likelihood of being invited for a job interview in Israel. We
added a racial component, as in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), to explore also the impact of
racial discrimination. To control either for racial discrimination and for discrimination based on
beauty, we sent 8 identical resumes to firms, 4 resumes with photo of attractive and unattractive
men and women, and 4 resumes without photo (two CVs for Italian people, a woman and a man,
and two for foreigners, a woman and a man). In this last case, African name and nationality are
indicated in order to control for racial discrimination.
Our design strategy allows us to examine whether there exists a preference for attractive candidates,
and whether this preference interacts with the applicant's sex and nationality. In our knowledge it is
the first paper exploring simultaneously beauty, gender and racial discrimination in the hiring
process in Italy.
Main results obtained by this paper show that attractive women and men get much more callbacks
(54% for attractive woman and 47% for attractive man) than unattractive ones, and that unattractive
women get less callbacks than unattractive men (7% for woman and 26% for man). Moreover,
foreign women get less callbacks than the average callback rate, but much more than unattractive
women (12% for foreign woman and 13% for foreign man). These results continue to hold even
considering jobs not involving any face-to-face contact and/or highly qualified jobs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the main literature on the
topic. The experimental design is described in Section 3. In Section 4 we present the main empirical
results. Section 5 provides the conclusions to the paper.

2. Related literature
Several jobs analyzed correlation between beauty and labor market, focalizing, in particular, on the
relation between beauty and wages.
Feingold (1992) analyzes the association between physical beauty, personality features, health,
cleverness and mental skills. In this respect. Harper (2000) finds that the penalty for being

unattractive is about 15% for men and 11% for women, because beauty is considered to be linked
with social skills, health and intelligence.
Etcoff, Haley, Vickery and House (2011) included make-up as an additional element influencing
common perception of individual’s features. In particular, they described the relationship between
beauty, make-up and perceived reliability. A jury had to assign a score from 1 to 7 to the same face,
before and after having changed make-up style from natural to professional, to glamorous. Jury
assigns a score for beauty, competence, pleasantness and reliability, assessing that make-up
produces a significant effect in terms of the level of competence perceived.
Mobius and Rosenblat (2006) provided evidence that the most beautiful workers are considered to
be more confident, and their self-confidence determine a pay rise.
Biddle and Hamermesh (1994) reached the similar conclusions studying data from the US and
Canada. Their main findings were as follows: attractiveness plays an important role in deciding
employees' earnings; the penalty for not being attractive is greater for women than men, and it is
robust across occupations.
In a different study on graduates from a prestigious law school (Biddle and Hamermesh, 1998), the
same authors found that a weakly positive and insignificant relationship between attractiveness and
earnings for lawyers becomes higher and significant as working years accrue.
More recently Boo et al. (2012) studied, the impact of beauty premium in the labor market sending
resumes to real job openings in Buenos Aires. In particular, they sent 6 resumes to each firm: 2
resumes with photos of attractive men or women, 2 with photos of unattractive men or women and
2 resumes without photo. They manipulated electronically real photos and made them unattractive
using Photoshop. While resumes containing photos manipulated in order to appear as unattractive
received 5% of callbacks, attractive photos received a callback rate of 36%.
The two papers most similar to ours in methodology are Ruffle and Sthudiner (2010) and Bertrand
and Mullainathan (2004). Both the papers studied real job opening posted by actual employers in
order to evaluate various kind of discriminations during the hiring process. While Ruffle and
Sthudiner (2010) studied discrimination based on beauty, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) studied
racial discrimination.
Ruffle and Sthudiner sent 5312 resumes answering to 2656 job postings in Israel. They sent to each
offer 6 different resumes, identical in every respect but the photo. They sent CVs including pictures
of attractive men, women, unattractive men and women and with no photo included. They could
study the photo effect because in Israel is not that common to include photos into resumes.
Attractive men got relevant higher callback rates than men resumes with no photo and double than
unattractive ones. On the contrary, for Israelian women the two authors found relevant evidence of
discrimination against attractiveness. Thus, beautiful women including a photo on their resumes
appear to be punished for their attractiveness and, consequently, to be more often discard by
recruiters.
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) sent 2435 fictitious resumes in the area of Boston and Chicago,
considering all the job offers in the Boston Globe and Chicago Tribute Sunday edition during the
period between July 2001 and May 2002 in order to study the impact of racial discrimination. They
sent 2 low profile CVs with African American names and White names and 2 high profile CVs with
African American names and White names. Using this method, the two authors found large racial
differences in callback rates. Applicants with White names needed to send about 10 CVs to get one
callback, whereas those with African American names had to send around 15 resumes to get one
callback. This 50 percent gap in callback rates is statistically significant. Based on their estimates, a
White name yields as many more callbacks as an additional eight years of experience and, since
applicants’ names are randomly assigned, this gap can only be attributed to name manipulation.

As in the papers previously mentioned, our study is based on real job opening posted by actual
employers. Moreover, it includes both the aspects considered by Ruffle and Sthudiner (2010) and
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), integrating the discrimination connected to attractiveness with
the one connected to racial discrimination.
In this respect, our research complements these studies. In effect, they found results on singular
reasons underlying discrimination occurring at the earliest stages of the hiring process. On the
contrary, we produced combined results in order to compare beauty, gender and nationality. .

3. Experimental design and procedures
Our empirical experiment focuses on the impact of attractiveness in the hiring process. Our study
analyzed all job postings displayed in the period between august 2011 and September 2012. In
particular, we submitted 11008 resumes in response to 1542 employments ads published in the most
important Italian job search website, that does not require registration (e.g. lavoratorio.it,
Lavoro&Stage, Miojob, Lavorare.net, Page Personnel, Trovalavoro, Kijiji, Inique Agenzia,
Archimede agenzia per il lavoro, Manpower divisione Horeca, Combinazioni s.r.l, Quanta agenzia
per il lavoro, Humangest, Alma, Orienta agenzia per il lavoro, Varese centro per l’impiego, Adecco,
Obiettivo lavoro, Temporary agenzia per il lavoro, Free work, Maw, Euro Interim, Mr
Comunication, Open Job).
We produced resumes based on the European format and structure and we use fictitious names and
addresses. To avoid matching problems, we modified them in order to fulfill the skills required by
the firms offering jobs. We sent same resumes with same skills several times to all the companies,
changing the photo attached or including no photo.
For choosing the pictures to be included in the resumes, we selected photographs from Internet and
we modified them in order to make them unrecognizable. We then asked 100 students at the
University of Messina to choose which of the people in the photos they considered to be attractive,
and unattractive. As almost all of them (92%) agreed on the classification, we are confident that
subjectivity can be excluded from the choice. We created a Gmail account for each of the candidate
categories, including this email address on the CV as contact information.
The same2 resume has been sent to firms 8 times: four resumes with different photos of applicants
and 4 without photos. In particular, a resume with photo have been sent including each time the
photo of attractive and unattractive Italian women, and attractive and unattractive Italian man. A
resume containing no photo of Italian and of African (African origin can be inferred by name and
nationality) person has been sent to each firm for both gender. In all, 9680 resumes for both male
and female vacancies were sent to 1210 firms. Applications from female (male) workers only were
invited by 127 (205) firms, and 508 (820) resumes were sent to them, in this last case each firm
received only four resumes per vacancy.
In terms of distribution by genders, we sent more resumes of men (almost 51%) than women
(almost 49%), because we got more job offers requesting exclusively men than exclusively women.
Moreover, we classified the CVs sent in terms of level of education required by the firm. According
to it, our dataset is composed by 25% of jobs requiring university degree, 43% requiring high
school diploma, and 32% of jobs not requiring any qualification.

2 Actually, following the same procedure adopted by Ruffle and Shtudiner (2010), in order not to let employers realize
that they were receiving identical resumes with different photos and names, we staggered over a few days the dispatch
of the CVs to the same firms. For the same reason, we used different names and addresses. Finally, all the residential
addresses belong to the city of Rome in order not to make the scrutinizers perceive differences in the candidates for
residential reasons.

5

An other distinction in our dataset is between functions offered in job postings. In this respect,
according to ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupation) definition, executive posts
accounted for 4.94% of job offers, specialized posts for 8.07%, technical jobs 37.39%, office jobs
13.59%, commercial posts 20.53%, artisans 7.99%, drivers 1.31% and unskilled work 6.18%.
Dividing work categories into jobs involving and not involving face-to-face contact and implying
and not implying physical strength we classified the CVs sent into front and back office, hard and
soft work jobs. We defined front office and hard work either labors for which firms explicitly ask
for, or the ones for which by no doubt it can be derived from ISCO classification. Approximately
59% are back office and 41% are front-office jobs, 16% are hard work jobs and 84% are the ones
which do not imply physical labor (soft work).
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of job openings in our dataset.
We also considered regional distribution of job offers (see Table 2). As it might be reasonably
expected Lombardy (16.86%), Veneto (9.92%), Tuscany (9.52%) and Lazio (18.02%) are the
regions with most of the job offers, while the other regions are characterized by far fewer vacancies.

4. Results
Table 2 and 3, already mentioned in Section 3, present also the results of the call back rates
classified according to our database. Analyzing callback rates in respect to attractiveness, we can
show that attractive Italian people have much higher call back rates (50%) than unattractive ones
(17%) and than Italians with no photo (39%). Also racial discrimination appears to be relevant.
Table 1 shows widely lower callback rates for foreigners candidates (13%). According to gender
classification, men get 32% of callbacks, while women get 28%.
Considering together beauty, nationality and gender, we obtained an interesting result in terms of
differences in callback rates.

Italian attractive women (from now on IAW) and Italian attractive man (from now on IAM) are
called back on average respectively 54% and 47% of the times. Gender is quite relevant for
unattractive candidates, indeed Italian unattractive men (from now on IUM) obtain 26% of
callbacks, while Italian unattractive women (IUW) obtain a widely lower callback rate (7%).
Attractiveness appears to be then widely relevant in the hiring process especially for women and, in
particular, for unattractive ones (Graf. 1).
In respect to racial discrimination, foreign people are relevantly lower called back than Italian
candidates, without relevant discrimination based on gender. Foreign women and men (from now
on NPFW and NPFM) are actually called back with almost the same percentage. (12% for NPFW,
and 13% for NPFM), but widely lower than the callback rate obtained by the correspondent Italians
resumes with no photo (37% for women and 41% for men).
According to the qualification required, we obtained the highest callback rates for jobs which do not
require any qualification (38%), while jobs for graduate candidates obtain 28% and jobs for which it
is required high school diplomas obtain 23% (Table 1).
In terms of ISCO classification of jobs, we have 43% for unskilled occupations, 41% for service
workers, 35% for workmen artisan and drivers, and 32% for executives and for clerical jobs.
Definitely lower callback rates characterize technical (27%) and specialized job (26%), and sales
workers (16%).
Regarding the categories hard and “soft” works and front and back office, we obtained 42% of
callback rates for jobs implying hard work, 27% for the ones not implying hard works, 31% for the
ones implying back office work and 28% for the ones implying front office works.

As displayed in Table 3, the jobs offered (i.e. the number of CVs sent to each region) differ among
regions according to the performance of the labor market in the area (as showed in Table 1). We
also expect some differences in call back rate, since in the South vacancies are fewer than in the
Center and in the North. For this reason, competition among applicants should be higher and thus
we may expect lower callback rate. On the contrary, differences in call back rates exist, but
companies placed in Umbria, Abruzzo, Trentino Alto Adige, Sicily, Campania and Calabria are
characterized by higher callback rates (respectively 39%, 36%, 35%, 34%, and 34%). Definitely
lower call back rates characterize, instead, regions like Molise, Valle D’Aosta, Lombardy, Marche,
Piedmont, and Tuscany (respectively 23% the first one, 25% the second and the third, 27% the
forth, the sixth and the seventh).

Our objective is to investigate whether regional differences, traditionally characterizing Italian labor
market are still the ones mainly influencing hiring decisions, or whether, instead, there are new
determinants to investigate and, if this is the case, which are the most relevant. In order to
investigate this issue, we performed an analysis of the variance classifying possible reasons of
discriminations into the ones associated to Gender, Nationality, Attractiveness, Jobs Classification
and/or Characteristics, Regions.
These variables, from Table 2 and 3, seems to determine differences in terms of job offers rates and
of call back rates. Secondly, we test some classification created by the “interaction” among these
single variables. The intuition is that the best classification to be chosen is the one which display the
highest variance between groups and the lowest within them.
Table 4 shows the results of the total variance analysis referred to the 11008 CVs sent and its
decomposition into particular subsamples. Analyzing all the single categories results on variance
decomposition, we note that the variance between groups is very low for regional (1% of total
variability) and ISCO job classification (1%). Also education (variance between amount to 2%) and
ISCO classification of jobs does not appear to be a good classifier. Good classifications can be
obtained only if we consider attractiveness and its interactions with gender and nationality.

Gender seems to be a bad classificatory variable (between variance amount to 0%). Only for
unattractive people this classification seem to work (between variance 17%). Attractiveness appears
to be relevant by itself (between 8%), even if it does not increase its relevance when considering its
interaction with gender. Even nationality appears to be relevant considered by itself (between
variance 5%), while its interaction with gender doesn’t seem to have any effect. We obtain the best
classification when we interact3 gender, nationality and attractiveness (variance between 13%).
Furthermore, other interesting results come out when we apply ANOVA on subsamples. In
particular, the impact of attractiveness seems to be gender bias, while no gender bias emerges for
foreign people. In any case, the results coming out from the analysis show new tendencies in hiring
process discrimination, which take into account determinants connected more to attractiveness than
any other kind of difference between candidates. More information can be extracted if we apply the
most relevant classification defined by ANOVA on the distribution of the CVs receiving
respectively positive and no answers. When we compare the conditioned distributions with the
theoretical one coming out from our experimental design, we immediately see that this distribution
is not independent from call back rates distribution. We test null hypothesis of independence
between classification and call backs in Table 5 and, rejecting the null, we have an additional check
to confirm the result of ANOVA.

H1 = dependence (marginal mean ≠ conditioned mean)
X2 di Pearson = 1432,62; Df = 7; P-value = 0
The discrepancies are significant; H0 = refuses
As shown in Table 6 conditioned distributions are different from marginal one, except for
unattractive men. Moreover, it is interesting to note that attractiveness appears to be much more
polarized for women than for men and that, in particular, the beauty penalization for unattractive
women is higher than the beauty premium for attractive ones.

5. Conclusion
From the performed analysis we observed the existence of a significant social problem of
discrimination in hiring process in Italy. Unlike what one could expect, discrimination in callback
rates is neither based on regional differences, nor on lower employability of women, but on other
aspects. In other word, the dualism in the labor market seems not to affect an applicant’s probability
to receive a positive callback from a firm 4. The new tendencies of employability are based on
attractiveness much more than traditional regional differences, or the ones based on education and
job characteristics. Moreover, in Italy we measured a relevant discrimination based on Nationality.
Gender’s impact on discrimination become trickier than the one which traditionally concerned
Italian labor market. In effect, gender seems to have little discriminatory effect considered by itself,
but it takes relevance when it is interacted with attractiveness, especially for women.
To summarize our main results, we could say that if you want a job in Italy and you are not Italian,
it will be difficult to find it, but it is always better to be foreigner than to be an unattractive Italian
woman. Thus, searching for a job seems to be just like a beauty contest: it is better for unattractive
women to invest on aesthetic surgery than in education.

number of vacancies is lower.
