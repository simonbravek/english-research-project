Sex and Physical Attractiveness of Raters and Applicants as
Determinants of Resume Evaluations

College of Business Administration
University of Tennessee
Male and female student "interviewers," classified as either high, moderate, or
low on physical attractiveness, evaluated 12 bogus job applicants for whom sex,
physical attractiveness, and qualifications had been varied. A 2 X 3 X 2 X 3 X 2
analysis of variance was computed, with the first two variables (interviewer
sex and attractiveness) constituting between-group factors, and the last three
variables (applicant sex, attractiveness, and qualifications) constituting repeated
measures factors. Regardless of interviewer sex and attractiveness, highly
qualified applicants were preferred over poorly qualified applicants, male applicants were preferred over female applicants, and attractive candidates were
preferred over unattractive candidates. Discrimination in employment decisions
was attributed to sex-role and physical attractiveness stereotypes.

Research on the interview has brought attention to biases that can limit the interview's
validity and reliability as a technique of personnel selection. Recently, Dipboye, Fromkin,
and Wiback (197S) added discrimination
against physically unattractive candidates to
the compendium of interviewer biases when
they found that male college recruiters and
business students were more willing to hire a
physically attractive candidate for a supervisory position than an equally qualified unattractive candidate. Also, male candidates
were preferred to female candidates, but contrary to the prediction that female attractiveness would be a more important determinant
of interviewer ratings than male attractiveness, attractive candidates were preferred over
unattractive candidates regardless of their sex,
The present study was intended to partially
replicate the Dipboye et al. study with student "interviewers" and to investigate the
possible interactions of applicant sex and
physical attractiveness with interviewer sex
and attractiveness in determining employment
evaluations.
We predicted that men and women both

would be biased against unattractive and female candidates and that no differences would
be found in the rating of the candidates as a
function of the rater's sex. This prediction
was suggested by previous findings that male
and female raters show a preference for physically attractive others that is unmitigated by
the sex of the rater (Byrne, London, &
Reeves, 1968; Cash, Begley, McCown, &
Weise, 1975; Dion, Berscheicl, & Walster,
1972; Miller, 1970). Also, males and females
have been shown to discriminate similarly
against females in salary decisions (Terborg &
Ilgen, 1974), evaluations of supervisory behavior (Rosen & Jerdee, 1973), evaluations
of intelligence (Lao, Upchurch, Corwin, &
Grossnickle, Note 1), and performance evaluation (Goldberg, 1968; Pheterson, Kiesler, &
Goldberg, 1971). A second prediction was
that an applicant similar to a rater in physical attractiveness would receive more favorable evaluations than an applicant who is
either more or less attractive than the rater.
Thus, a highly attractive rater would give
highest ratings to a highly attractive applicant, a moderately attractive rater would
rate a moderately attractive applicant most
favorably, and an unattractive rater would

was suggested by findings of matching in
dating behavior (Berscheid, Dion, Walster, &
Walster, 1971; Murstein, 1972; Silverman,
1971) and by findings that interviewers are
more favorably disposed toward applicants
who are similar to themselves (Rand & Wexley, 197S; Wexley & Nemeroff, 197S).
In summary, we predicted that male applicants would receive higher evaluations than
females and that physically attractive applicants would receive higher evaluations than
unattractive applicants. Although no differences were predicted between male and female
student raters in their evaluations of the
applicants, a Rater Attractiveness X Applicant
Attractiveness interaction was predicted in
which candidates matching the rater's level
of attractiveness would receive the highest
ratings. In order to test these predictions, a
laboratory experiment was conducted in
which male and female subjects, classified as
highly attractive, moderately attractive, or
unattractive, evaluated male and female applicants who were also high, moderate, or low
on attractiveness and either highly qualified
or poorly qualified for the position.
Method
Subjects and Design
One hundred and ten Caucasian college students
participated in the study in order to fulfill their introductory psychology research requirement. The design was 2 X 3 X 2 X 2 X 3 factorial, the independent
variables being rater sex (male, female), rater physical attractiveness (high, moderate, and low), applicant qualifications (high and low), applicant sex
(male and female), and applicant physical attractiveness (high, moderate, and low). Rater sex and attractiveness were between-group factors, and there
were repeated measures on the applicant qualifications, sex, and attractivenesss factors. After discarding the data of 14 subjects to equalize cell sizes, final
analyses were performed on the data of 96 subjects.

Procedure
Subjects participated in 23 experimental sessions
with 5-8 subjects in each session. At the beginning
of a session, an experimenter read instructions describing the study as an investigation of information
processing in the selection interview. Subjects were
told that -their task would be first to review a job
description and then to evaluate the qualifications of
12 applicants for that job on the basis of their
resumes.

289

Measurement of rater physical attractiveness. The
room in which the study was conducted contained a
one-way mirror allowing unobtrusive measurement
of the rater's physical attractiveness. Two graduate
student experimenters, one male and the other female, independently rated each subject on facial features, body proportion, general appearance, posture,
weight, and overall physical attractiveness. An attractiveness score consisted of summed ratings on
these six dimensions for a subject. A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient computed on the
two scores obtained for each subject was .84 and
indicated a high degree of interrater reliability. Subjects were classified as high, moderate, or low on
attractiveness depending on whether they were in
the top, middle, or lowest third on the sum of the
two experimenters' attractiveness ratings.
Job description. The job for which the applicants
were evaluated was that of trainee in sales management. Subjects were given a job description that
stated in sex-neutral terms the duties and requirements of the position:
The requirements of a managerial job in this firm
include the ability to motivate sales personnel, the
ability to make prompt and explicit decisions,
clarity of thought in stressful situations, the ability
to foresee management problems and initiate plans
and actions promptly to ward off these problems,
and the ability to communicate effectively with
and ensure cooperation with other parts of the
company and the public.
Manipulation of applicant sex and qualifications.
Each subject evaluated 12 applicants. In order to add
realism to the task, each applicant's qualifications
were described on a standard resume form used by
students interviewing at the Placement Office of the
University of Tennessee. The resumes contained a
variety of information, including extracurricular activities, a brief statement of career goals, hobbies,
and percentage of college expenses earned. The qualifications of the candidates were manipulated by varying the grade point average and past work experience.
In six of the resumes, the applicants were depicted as
highly qualified for the job as revealed by a good
grade point average (3.45-3.81) and past work experience in sales. The six low-qualifications resumes
displayed low grade point averages (2.24-2.42) and
no past work in sales. Sex of the candidates was
manipulated by depicting half or 6 of the applicants
as male and the other half as female. All other information on the resumes besides sex, grade point,
and work experience depicted the 12 candidates as
equally qualified for the job.
Manipulation of applicant attractiveness. The
physical attractiveness of the applicants was manipulated by attaching to the resumes glossy yearbook
pictures of Caucasian students found in pilot research
to be high, moderate, or low on attractiveness. A
minimum of 12 pictures was needed, 2 for each of
the 6 possible combinations of applicant sex and attractiveness. Using the same pictures for each subject

male pictures were selected at random for a given
subject, and these two pictures were assigned at
random to low- and high-qualifications resumes.
The same procedure was followed for the 5 remaining sex-attractiveness combinations. The 12 resumes
were presented to a subject in a randomly determined
order.
Dependent measures. After reviewing a resume,
subjects evaluated the applicant on two dependent
measures. First, they indicated their willingness to
hire the applicant on a 7-point Likert scale, the end
points being "definitely would not recommend hiring" (1) and "definitely would recommend hiring"
( 7 ) . This item measured what Terborg and Ilgen
(1975) would refer to as entry discrimination. A second item measured what the same authors would
refer to as treatment discrimination. Subjects were
asked to assume that they had hired the applicant
and to state the starting salary they would provide.
The alternatives ranged from $8,000-$8,999 (1) to
$20,000-$21,999 (7). After subjects had rated all
resumes on the main dependent measures, they were
asked to choose the one applicant they would hire if
they had to choose only one. Finally, they were
asked to rate each of the 12 applicants for the job
on a series of bipolar adjectives.

Results
Manipulation Checks
Two of the bipolar adjectives were physically unattractive (1)-physically attractive
(7) and unqualified (l)-qualified (7). These
items allowed a check on the experimental
manipulations of attractiveness and qualifications. The means for the applicants high,
moderate, and low on attractiveness on the

and each condition could have confounded the
manipulations with specific characteristics of individual pictures. To provide stimulus sampling and to
avoid this confound, 4 pictures were used for each
of the 6 applicant sex-attractiveness conditions, with

tively) than if the candidate had high qualifications (Ms - 5.74, 5.80, and 5.92 for the
low-, moderate-, and high-attractiveness
groups, respectively). A Newman-Keuls analysis performed on the means of the interaction indicated that the only nonsignificant
differences were between the moderate- and
low-attractiveness conditions of the low-qualifications candidates.

Analysis of Hire Ratings
A 2 X 3 X 2 X 2 X 3 analysis o f variance
was performed on subject ratings of willingness to hire the candidates and is summarized
in Table 1. Table 2 gives the relevant means
based on this analysis. The findings of Dipboye et al. (1975) were replicated, with main
effects found for applicant sex, physical attractiveness, and qualifications. Subjects were
more willing to recommend hiring a candidate
with high qualifications (M — S.82) than a
candidate with low qualifications (M = 3.57),
F(l, 90) - 563.93, p < .001, r,2 = .50; they
were more willing to hire a male (M = 4.82)
than a female (M = 4.58), F(l, 90) = 20.44,
p < .001, -if = .006; and they were more willing to hire a highly attractive candidate (M
= 4.93) and a moderately attractive candidate (M = 4.74) than an unattractive candidate (M = 4.42), F(2, 180) = 24,80, p<
.001, tf = 0.18.
Two interaction effects were significant, and
Newman-Keuls analyses were performed to
provide an interpretation. A significant Applicant Sex X Applicant Attractiveness interaction, F(2, 180) = 5.02, p < .001, if = .002,
showed that the attractive male was rated
significantly higher (M = 5.09) than the attractive female applicant (M = 4.78; p <
.05) and that the unattractive male was rated
higher (M = 4.61) than the unattractive female (M = 4.23; p < .05). However, the
ratings given to moderately attractive male
(M = 4.75) and female (M - 4.12) applicants did not significantly differ. An Applicant Qualifications X Applicant Attractiveness interaction, 77(2/180) = 19.64, p <
.001, rf = .008, showed that the effects of
physical attractiveness were more pronounced
if the candidate had low qualifications (Ms =
3.10, 3.60, and 3,94 for the low-, moderate-,
and high-attractiveness candidates, respec-

Analysis of Salary Rat-ings
The same main effects were found for salary
decisions as were found for hiring ratings (see
Tables 1 and 2). Higher salaries were given
to a highly qualified candidate (M — 2.63)
than to a poorly qualified candidate (M =
1.72), F(l, 90) = 163.80, p < .001, rf =
.168; to a male (M — 2.26) than to a female
(M = 2.09), F(l, 90) = 31.19, p < .001, rf
= .006; and to a highly attractive candidate
(M — 2.27) and moderately attractive candidate (M = 2.16) than to an unattractive
candidate (M - 2.09), F ( 2 , 180) = 10.6, p
< .001, -if — .004. Two interactions were
found in the analysis of salary decisions and
Newman-Keuls analyses were performed on
each. An Applicant Qualifications X Applicant Attractiveness interaction, F(2, 180) =
7.04, p < .001, if = .002, revealed significant
differences among physical attractiveness levels for low qualification candidates (Ms =
1.56, 1.73, and 1.86, for the low-, moderate-,
and high-attractiveness candidates, respectively) but nonsignificant differences for the
high qualification candidates (Ms = 2.63,
2.59, and 2.69 for the low, moderate-, and
high-attractiveness candidates, respectively).
A significant Applicant Qualifications X Applicant Sex X Rater Sex interaction, F(l, 90)
= 4.14, p < .05, if = .001, revealed that male
candidates were given higher salaries than female candidates in every condition with the
exception of one. When the candidate had low
qualifications and the rater was male, the difference in salary given to the male and to the
female was nonsignificant.

analysis of variance, the small eta-square values and the small differences between means
raise doubts as to whether or not subjects
would, in reality, discriminate against women
and those perceived as unattractive to any
serious extent. To provide another test of the
predictions, subjects were asked to choose the
one candidate they would hire if there was
only one opening to be filled,
In Table 3, the frequencies and percentages
of subjects choosing each of the 12 candidates
have been summarized. The most frequently
chosen applicant was the highly qualified, attractive male, who was selected by 55% of
the subjects. If one assumes that the grade
point and job experience information constituted the only bona fide job qualifications
and that subjects did not discriminate on the
basis of applicant sex and attractiveness, then
the six highly qualified applicants should have
been chosen with equal frequency. However,
the number of male and female raters choosing a highly qualified male candidate (/ =
59) was significantly greater than the number
choosing a highly qualified female candidate
(/ = 3 1 ) , x 2 ( l ) = &.n,p < .OS. Also, the frequencies with which highly qualified, attractive (/ = 41), moderately attractive (/ = 21),
and unattractive ( / = 28) candidates were

chosen differed significantly from frequencies
expected on the basis of chance ( / = 30),
X 2 ( 2 ) - 6.86, p < .05. Thus, it appears that
subjects discriminated in their choice of a
candidate against women and those perceived
as unattractive. Male raters did not differ
from female raters in either the frequency
with which they chose a highly qualified male
over a highly qualified female, x 2 U ) = 2.20,
ns, or in the frequency with which they chose
a highly attractive over moderately attractive
and unattractive candidates, x z ( 2 ) = 3.37, ns.
Rater attractiveness had no effect on the
selection of a candidate. The frequencies with
which a highly attractive, moderately attractive, and unattractive candidate was chosen
were 17, 7, and 8, respectively, for the unattractive raters; 15, 10, and 7, respectively,
for the moderately attractive raters; and 13,
7, and 12, respectively, for the highly attractive raters. Choice of a candidate on the basis
of attractiveness did not differ as a function
of rater attractiveness, x 2 ( 4 ) = 4 -09, ns.
Thus, the matching hypothesis was confirmed
in neither the analysis of variance of ratings
nor the analysis of hiring choices.
Analysis of Bipolar Adjective Ratings

with sex stereotypes. Female applicants, relative to the male applicants, were rated as less
experienced, decisive, informed, competitive,
motivated, logical, and assertive. On the other
hand, females were rated as friendlier, warmer,
and more emotional than the males. Males
and females were rated as equally competent
and intelligent. The mean ratings of male and
female candidates are reported in Table 4.
Similar to the differences found for applicant sex, subjects perceived differences among
the attractiveness groups on the bipolar adjectives such that highly attractive candidates
were perceived as possessing more favorable
characteristics on all the adjectives listed in
Table 3 with the exception of the intelligentunintelligent bipolar adjective. No differences
were found on this item.1
Discussion
From the findings of the present study as
well as the Dipboye et al. (1975) study, one
may conclude that the candidate perceived as
most qualified for a managerial position was
not only highly qualified with respect to
scholastic record and work experience but also
was physically attractive and male. However,
bias against female applicants on the willingness to hire ratings was limited to situations
in which the applicants were highly attractive
and unattractive and was less pronounced
when the applicants were moderately attractive. Also, bias against those perceived as unattractive was more pronounced when the
candidates had low qualifications than when
candidates had high qualifications, a finding
that is similar to results reported by Landy
and Sigall (1974). Despite the evidence of
bias, our study and past research (Carlson,
1967; Dipboye et al., 197S; Hamner, Kim,
Baird, & Bigoness, 1974) indicate that sex
and physical appearance account for only
trivial proportions of rating variance. However, discrimination against females and those
perceived as unattractive in the present experiment seemed to have emerged more clearly
than indicated in the ratings when subjects
chose the one candidate they would hire. A
plausible explanation for the treatment and
entry discrimination was that subjects possessed sex and attractiveness stereotypes. In
support of such a position and consistent with

293

sex-role research (Broverman, Broverman,
Clarkson, Rosenkrantz, & Vogel, 1970;
Schein, 1973) and physical attractiveness research (Cash et al., 1975; Dion, Berscheid, &
Walster, 1972; Miller, 1970), subjects attributed more favorable traits to applicants who
were highly attractive than to applicants who
were unattractive, and they attributed more
favorable traits to male applicants than to
female applicants.
Neither interviewer sex nor physical attractiveness were associated with the ratings or
choice of candidates. Women in this study
were as biased against women and those perceived as unattractive as were men, which suggests that placing more women in positions in
which they conduct the interviews and make
the employment decisions may not eliminate
bias in the employment process. The elimination of bias may require the modification of
the stereotypes that both men and women
possess (Schein, 1973, 1975), Just as women
were willing to discriminate against other
women, people who were judged as unattractive on the basis of white American norms discriminated against other unattractive persons
and preferred a physically attractive applicant. A situation in which the predicted
matching effect might occur would be one in
which the interviewer anticipated future interaction with the interviewee, a situation in
which an attractive candidate might pose a
potential threat to the interviewer's selfesteem (Huston, 1973).
There are several cautions that should be
observed in interpreting the data of the
present study. First, undergraduate college
students were used in order to compare the
employment decisions of males and females,
a comparison that is not easily made given
the scarcity of professional female interviewers and recruiters. Although past research supports the use of college students as interviewers (Bernstein, Hakel, & Harlan, 1975; Dipboye et al., 1975), caution must still be used
in generalizing to professional interviewers. A
second limitation is that bias against female
and unattractive applicants for managerial

positions may not generalize to other types of
positions. Indeed, Cohen and Bunker (1975)
found that interviewers were biased against
male applicants for traditionally female roles
just as they were biased against female applicants for traditionally male roles. Similar research is needed to determine whether bias
against physically unattractive persons occurs
across a variety of positions or whether it is
specific to certain types of positions, such as
those that are visible and require social interaction. A third caution is that these findings
may be more relevant to the preinterview
phase, in which the resume and other summarized applicant characteristics are evaluated, than to the interview itself. For instance,
sex and attractiveness may account for even
less rating variance in a realistic interview setting where the interviewer may observe a
variety of interviewee characteristics in addition to the limited information contained on
a resume. Despite these limitations, it seems
reasonable to conclude that sex and physical
attractiveness biases exist, influence simulated
employment judgments, and are deserving of
study by industrial and organizational psychologists.
