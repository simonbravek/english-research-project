# Transcript (Idea Bullets)

## Slide 1 - Title: Does a Photo Help Your Job Application?

- Hook: "Imagine two applicants with the same experience and the same CV. One adds a photo. The other doesn't. Who gets the interview?"
- One-sentence topic: how photos (on CVs and online) change early hiring decisions.
- Mention scope: focus on countries where adding a photo is culturally acceptable/optional (not places where it is strongly discouraged).

## Slide 2 - Research question

- State research question clearly: How does including a photo in a traditional CV application for a standard job affect the likelihood of being invited for an interview in countries where both options are culturally acceptable?
- Define what I mean by "accepted": invited for an interview / positive callback.
- Engagement (show of hands): "If a photo was optional, who would include one?"
- Follow-up: ask 1-2 students for reasons (trust, professionalism, memorability vs bias risk).
- Transition: "Now let's make sure we all understand why researchers think a photo could matter." 

## Slide 3 - Background

- Cultural context: CV-photo norms differ by country; in some places it is normal/optional, in others it is discouraged.
- Key concept: "beauty premium" = attractive candidates get better outcomes; "beauty penalty" can also happen.
- Why first stage matters: recruiters often decide quickly, so appearance can act like a shortcut for assumptions about personality, competence, or "fit".
- Preview the puzzle: results can flip by gender and setting (field experiments show this clearly).

## Slide 4 - Methodology

- What counts as evidence here:
  - Materials consulted: journal articles and working papers accessed as PDFs.
  - Correspondence (field) experiments: researchers send fake CVs to real job ads; change only the photo or a photo-related signal; measure callbacks.
  - Laboratory experiment: raters score resumes where attractiveness and sex are manipulated.
- Why field experiments are powerful:
  - Controls qualifications: CVs are "otherwise identical".
  - Measures real employer behavior, not just what people claim they would do.
- Note limits:
  - Measures early stage (callbacks), not job performance.
  - Results vary by country and hiring culture.

## Slide 5 - Findings: Israel (Ruffle and Shtudiner)

- Study design:
  - Israel; photo is optional; paired CV strategy.
  - 5,312 CVs sent to 2,656 job openings (Ruffle and Shtudiner 1).
  - Each job ad got a picture CV and an otherwise identical no-photo CV.
- Main results (callbacks):
  - Men: attractive > no photo > plain. Attractive men got 19.7% callbacks vs 13.7% with no photo and 9.2% for plain (Ruffle and Shtudiner 9-10).
  - Women: no photo did best (16.6%), then plain (13.6%), then attractive (12.8%) (Ruffle and Shtudiner 9-10).
- Interpretation cue (without over-claiming):
  - The paper discusses that female jealousy/envy may contribute, especially when companies hire directly rather than agencies (Ruffle and Shtudiner 13-15).
- Engagement:
  - "Why might a photo help men but hurt women in the same labor market?" Take 2-3 guesses.

## Slide 6 - Findings: Italy (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli)

- Study design:
  - Italy; monitored job agencies/sites; sent 11,008 CVs to 1,542 ads (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 1).
  - Sent multiple versions to each job opening (including attractive/unattractive photos and no-photo Italian/foreign applicants).
- Main results (their summary):
  - Attractive women: 54% callback; attractive men: 47% (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 6).
  - Unattractive men: 26%; unattractive women: 7% (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 6-7).
  - No-photo Italians: around 37% (women) and 41% (men); foreign no-photo: about 12-13% (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 6-7).
- What makes this striking:
  - Huge attractiveness effect for women at both ends: being "unattractive" is punished severely.
  - They also find nationality/race discrimination, but argue appearance effects are even larger (Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 4, 9-10).
- Engagement:
  - "If you were advising a friend applying in Italy, what would you tell them about adding a photo?" (Let 1 student answer.)

## Slide 7 - Findings: Facebook profile photos (Baert)

- Setup:
  - Belgium field experiment; candidates differed only in the Facebook profile that could be found online with their name (Baert 1).
  - Focus on the profile picture because it is often the only public element recruiters can see.
- Key result:
  - Best Facebook picture produced about 38% more interview invitations than the worst (Baert 11).
  - Regression framing: Picture 1 increases interview invitation probability by about 2.6 percentage points compared to the worst picture (Baert 11).
  - Suggestive heterogeneity: effects stronger for highly educated and with female recruiters (Baert 9-11).
- Transition line:
  - "So even if you *don't* put a photo on the CV, your online photo can still become the photo they judge." 
- Engagement:
  - "Do you think employers should tell applicants if they checked social media? Why/why not?" 1-2 responses.

## Slide 8 - Findings: Stereotypes in resume evaluation (Dipboye, Arvey, and Terpstra)

- Why include an older lab study:
  - It helps explain the mechanism: how raters combine 'qualifications' with appearance.
- Design:
  - Student interviewers rated bogus applicants; manipulated applicant sex, attractiveness, and qualifications (Dipboye, Arvey, and Terpstra 288-90).
- Main findings:
  - Regardless of interviewer sex/attractiveness: higher qualifications help most.
  - But: male applicants preferred to female; attractive preferred to unattractive (Dipboye, Arvey, and Terpstra 291-92).
  - Most frequently chosen applicant: highly qualified, attractive male (Dipboye, Arvey, and Terpstra 292).
- Point to connect back:
  - Even when discrimination effects look "small" in average ratings, they show up clearly when people must pick one candidate (Dipboye, Arvey, and Terpstra 292).

## Slide 9 - Conclusion

- Direct answer:
  - Including a photo can help, hurt, or do nothing, depending on context.
  - Field evidence shows: it can boost attractive men in Israel, hurt women who include photos in Israel, and strongly reward attractiveness in Italy (Ruffle and Shtudiner 9-10; Busetta, Fiorillo, and Visalli 6-7).
  - Even when you avoid CV photos, recruiters may still judge you through online photos (Baert 11).
- What it means (interpretation):
  - Photos make appearance-based bias easier at the earliest screening stage.
  - This can intersect with gender and nationality discrimination.
- End with a discussion question (engagement, not monologue):
  - "Should companies remove photos from applications (anonymous CVs), or is that unrealistic now that social media exists?"
